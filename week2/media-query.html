            <h2>Alma 18:2</h2>
            <p>And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon 
                <br>in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, 
                <br>he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man.
                <br> Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?</p>

            <p>Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished,
                <br> because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been 
                <br>so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.</p>
